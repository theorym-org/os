# Groups

The concept of a *group* stands as one of the most profound and far-reaching ideas in all of mathematics. Born from the study of polynomial equations in the early nineteenth century—through the revolutionary work of Évariste Galois—group theory has since permeated virtually every branch of mathematics and physics. From the symmetries of geometric figures to the structure of fundamental particles, from cryptographic protocols to the classification of surfaces, groups provide the language through which we understand symmetry and structure.

This chapter develops the theory of groups from first principles. We begin with the axioms that define a group, proceed to establish the fundamental properties that all groups share, and then explore the rich landscape of examples that motivate and illuminate the abstract theory.

## 1.1 Binary Operations

Before we can define a group, we must first make precise what we mean by an *operation* on a set. The familiar operations of addition and multiplication on numbers serve as prototypes, but the abstract notion is far more general.

<Definition number="1.1.1" name="Binary Operation">
Let $S$ be a non-empty set. A **binary operation** on $S$ is a function
$$\star : S \times S \to S$$
that assigns to each ordered pair $(a, b)$ of elements of $S$ a unique element $a \star b$ of $S$.
</Definition>

The requirement that $a \star b \in S$ for all $a, b \in S$ is called **closure**. This is not an additional axiom but rather part of what it means to be a binary operation on $S$. When we write $\star : S \times S \to S$, we are asserting that the operation takes any two elements of $S$ and produces an element of $S$.

<Example number="1.1.2" name="Standard Operations">
The following are binary operations:
1. Addition on $\mathbb{Z}$: for any $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$, we have $a + b \in \mathbb{Z}$
2. Multiplication on $\mathbb{R}$: for any $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $a \cdot b \in \mathbb{R}$
3. Composition of functions: if $f, g : X \to X$, then $f \circ g : X \to X$
</Example>

<Example number="1.1.3" name="Non-Examples">
The following fail to be binary operations:
1. Division on $\mathbb{R}$: $a / b$ is undefined when $b = 0$
2. Subtraction on $\mathbb{N}$: $2 - 5 = -3 \notin \mathbb{N}$ (closure fails)
</Example>

<Definition number="1.1.4" name="Properties of Binary Operations">
Let $\star$ be a binary operation on a set $S$. We say that $\star$ is:

1. **Associative** if $(a \star b) \star c = a \star (b \star c)$ for all $a, b, c \in S$
2. **Commutative** if $a \star b = b \star a$ for all $a, b \in S$
</Definition>

<Remark>
Associativity allows us to write $a \star b \star c$ without ambiguity. Commutativity, while a pleasant property, is *not* required for most of our theory—and indeed, some of the most important groups are non-commutative.
</Remark>

## 1.2 The Definition of a Group

We now arrive at the central definition of this chapter. A group is a set equipped with a binary operation satisfying three fundamental axioms.

<Definition number="1.2.1" name="Group">
A **group** is an ordered pair $(G, \star)$ where $G$ is a non-empty set and $\star$ is a binary operation on $G$ satisfying the following axioms:

**(G1) Associativity.** For all $a, b, c \in G$:
$$(a \star b) \star c = a \star (b \star c)$$

**(G2) Identity.** There exists an element $e \in G$ such that for all $a \in G$:
$$e \star a = a \star e = a$$

**(G3) Inverses.** For each $a \in G$, there exists an element $a^{-1} \in G$ such that:
$$a \star a^{-1} = a^{-1} \star a = e$$
</Definition>

<Remark>
Several observations are in order:

1. The axioms are listed in order of decreasing generality. Many algebraic structures satisfy (G1) alone (semigroups) or (G1) and (G2) (monoids). Groups require all three.

2. Closure is implicit in the statement that $\star$ is a binary operation on $G$.

3. The identity axiom requires $e$ to be a *two-sided* identity: it must work on both the left and the right. Similarly, the inverse axiom requires *two-sided* inverses.
</Remark>

<Definition number="1.2.2" name="Abelian Group">
A group $(G, \star)$ is called **abelian** (or **commutative**) if for all $a, b \in G$:
$$a \star b = b \star a$$
The term honors Niels Henrik Abel (1802–1829), who made fundamental contributions to the theory of equations.
</Definition>

<Definition number="1.2.3" name="Order of a Group">
The **order** of a group $G$, denoted $|G|$, is the cardinality of the underlying set. If $|G|$ is finite, we say $G$ is a **finite group**; otherwise, $G$ is an **infinite group**.
</Definition>

## 1.3 Fundamental Properties

The axioms of a group, though minimal, have powerful consequences. We now establish several fundamental properties that hold in *every* group.

<Theorem number="1.3.1" name="Uniqueness of Identity">
In any group $(G, \star)$, the identity element is unique.
</Theorem>

<Proof>
Suppose $e$ and $e'$ are both identity elements in $G$. We shall show that $e = e'$.

Since $e$ is an identity, we have $e \star e' = e'$.

Since $e'$ is an identity, we have $e \star e' = e$.

Therefore $e = e \star e' = e'$, as required.
</Proof>

<Theorem number="1.3.2" name="Uniqueness of Inverses">
In any group $(G, \star)$, each element has a unique inverse.
</Theorem>

<Proof>
Let $a \in G$ and suppose that both $b$ and $c$ are inverses of $a$. Then:
$$b = b \star e = b \star (a \star c) = (b \star a) \star c = e \star c = c$$
where we have used associativity and the defining property of inverses.
</Proof>

The uniqueness of inverses justifies our notation $a^{-1}$ for *the* inverse of $a$.

<Theorem number="1.3.3" name="Cancellation Laws">
Let $(G, \star)$ be a group and let $a, b, c \in G$. Then:
1. **Left cancellation:** If $a \star b = a \star c$, then $b = c$
2. **Right cancellation:** If $b \star a = c \star a$, then $b = c$
</Theorem>

<Proof>
We prove left cancellation; right cancellation is similar.

Suppose $a \star b = a \star c$. Multiplying both sides on the left by $a^{-1}$:
$$a^{-1} \star (a \star b) = a^{-1} \star (a \star c)$$
By associativity:
$$(a^{-1} \star a) \star b = (a^{-1} \star a) \star c$$
Since $a^{-1} \star a = e$:
$$e \star b = e \star c$$
Therefore $b = c$.
</Proof>

<Theorem number="1.3.4" name="Inverse of a Product">
Let $(G, \star)$ be a group and let $a, b \in G$. Then:
$$(a \star b)^{-1} = b^{-1} \star a^{-1}$$
</Theorem>

<Proof>
We verify that $b^{-1} \star a^{-1}$ satisfies the defining property of the inverse of $a \star b$:
$$(a \star b) \star (b^{-1} \star a^{-1}) = a \star (b \star b^{-1}) \star a^{-1} = a \star e \star a^{-1} = a \star a^{-1} = e$$
Similarly, $(b^{-1} \star a^{-1}) \star (a \star b) = e$. By uniqueness of inverses, $(a \star b)^{-1} = b^{-1} \star a^{-1}$.
</Proof>

<Remark>
The formula $(ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}$ is sometimes called the "socks and shoes" rule: to undo putting on socks then shoes, you must first remove shoes, then socks. The order reverses.
</Remark>

<Corollary number="1.3.5">
For any element $a$ in a group $G$: $(a^{-1})^{-1} = a$.
</Corollary>

<Proof>
The element $a$ satisfies $a^{-1} \star a = a \star a^{-1} = e$, which is precisely the condition for $a$ to be the inverse of $a^{-1}$.
</Proof>

## 1.4 Examples of Groups

The abstract definition of a group encompasses an enormous variety of mathematical structures. We now survey the most important examples, which will serve as touchstones throughout our study.

### Additive Groups of Numbers

<Example number="1.4.1" name="The Integers">
The set $\mathbb{Z}$ of integers forms a group under addition, denoted $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$:
- **Closure:** The sum of two integers is an integer
- **Associativity:** $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$ for all $a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z}$
- **Identity:** The integer $0$ satisfies $0 + a = a + 0 = a$
- **Inverses:** For each $a \in \mathbb{Z}$, the integer $-a$ satisfies $a + (-a) = 0$

This group is abelian and infinite.
</Example>

<Example number="1.4.2" name="Rational, Real, and Complex Numbers">
Similarly, $(\mathbb{Q}, +)$, $(\mathbb{R}, +)$, and $(\mathbb{C}, +)$ are all abelian groups under addition.
</Example>

### Multiplicative Groups

<Example number="1.4.3" name="Non-zero Rationals">
The set $\mathbb{Q}^* = \mathbb{Q} \setminus \{0\}$ forms a group under multiplication:
- **Identity:** The number $1$ satisfies $1 \cdot a = a \cdot 1 = a$
- **Inverses:** For each $a \in \mathbb{Q}^*$, the number $1/a$ satisfies $a \cdot (1/a) = 1$

Note that we must exclude $0$ because it has no multiplicative inverse.
</Example>

<Example number="1.4.4" name="Positive Reals">
The set $\mathbb{R}^+ = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : x > 0\}$ forms an abelian group under multiplication.
</Example>

### Modular Arithmetic

<Example number="1.4.5" name="Integers Modulo n">
For any positive integer $n$, the set $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}$ forms a group under addition modulo $n$:
- **Identity:** $0$
- **Inverse of $a$:** $n - a$ (when $a \neq 0$)

This is a finite abelian group of order $n$.
</Example>

<Example number="1.4.6" name="Units Modulo n">
The set $(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^* = \{a \in \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} : \gcd(a, n) = 1\}$ forms a group under multiplication modulo $n$. The order of this group is $\phi(n)$, Euler's totient function.
</Example>

### Matrix Groups

<Example number="1.4.7" name="General Linear Group">
The **general linear group** $\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{R})$ consists of all invertible $n \times n$ matrices with real entries, under matrix multiplication:
$$\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{R}) = \{A \in M_n(\mathbb{R}) : \det(A) \neq 0\}$$
This is a non-abelian group for $n \geq 2$.
</Example>

<Example number="1.4.8" name="Special Linear Group">
The **special linear group** $\text{SL}_n(\mathbb{R}) = \{A \in \text{GL}_n(\mathbb{R}) : \det(A) = 1\}$ is a subgroup of $\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{R})$.
</Example>

### Symmetry Groups

<Example number="1.4.9" name="Symmetric Group">
The **symmetric group** $S_n$ consists of all bijections from $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ to itself, under composition of functions. These bijections are called **permutations**.

The order of $S_n$ is $n!$ (factorial). For $n \geq 3$, the group $S_n$ is non-abelian.
</Example>

<Example number="1.4.10" name="Dihedral Group">
The **dihedral group** $D_n$ is the group of symmetries of a regular $n$-gon, including both rotations and reflections. It has order $2n$ and is non-abelian for $n \geq 3$.
</Example>

## 1.5 Subgroups

A *subgroup* is a subset of a group that is itself a group under the inherited operation. Subgroups are fundamental to understanding the internal structure of groups.

<Definition number="1.5.1" name="Subgroup">
Let $(G, \star)$ be a group. A subset $H \subseteq G$ is a **subgroup** of $G$, written $H \leq G$, if $(H, \star)$ is itself a group under the same operation.
</Definition>

<Theorem number="1.5.2" name="Subgroup Criterion">
Let $G$ be a group and let $H$ be a non-empty subset of $G$. Then $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ if and only if:
1. For all $a, b \in H$, we have $ab \in H$ (closure)
2. For all $a \in H$, we have $a^{-1} \in H$ (closure under inverses)
</Theorem>

<Proof>
($\Rightarrow$) If $H$ is a subgroup, then it is a group, so it must be closed under the operation and under taking inverses.

($\Leftarrow$) Suppose $H$ satisfies conditions (1) and (2). We verify the group axioms:
- **Associativity:** Inherited from $G$
- **Identity:** Since $H$ is non-empty, there exists $a \in H$. By (2), $a^{-1} \in H$. By (1), $e = a \cdot a^{-1} \in H$.
- **Inverses:** Given by condition (2)
- **Closure:** Given by condition (1)
</Proof>

<Theorem number="1.5.3" name="One-Step Subgroup Test">
Let $G$ be a group and let $H$ be a non-empty subset of $G$. Then $H \leq G$ if and only if for all $a, b \in H$, we have $ab^{-1} \in H$.
</Theorem>

<Example number="1.5.4" name="Trivial Subgroups">
Every group $G$ has at least two subgroups:
1. The **trivial subgroup** $\{e\}$
2. The **improper subgroup** $G$ itself

A subgroup $H$ with $\{e\} \subsetneq H \subsetneq G$ is called a **proper non-trivial subgroup**.
</Example>

<Example number="1.5.5" name="Subgroups of Integers">
The subgroups of $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$ are precisely the sets $n\mathbb{Z} = \{nk : k \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ for $n \geq 0$. Thus:
$$\{0\} \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq 6\mathbb{Z} \subsetneq 3\mathbb{Z} \subsetneq \mathbb{Z}$$
</Example>

## 1.6 Group Homomorphisms

A *homomorphism* is a function between groups that respects the group structure. Homomorphisms are the "structure-preserving maps" of group theory.

<Definition number="1.6.1" name="Group Homomorphism">
Let $(G, \star)$ and $(H, \cdot)$ be groups. A function $\phi : G \to H$ is a **homomorphism** if for all $a, b \in G$:
$$\phi(a \star b) = \phi(a) \cdot \phi(b)$$
</Definition>

The condition says that $\phi$ "respects" or "preserves" the group operation: combining elements in $G$ and then applying $\phi$ gives the same result as applying $\phi$ first and then combining in $H$.

<Theorem number="1.6.2" name="Properties of Homomorphisms">
Let $\phi : G \to H$ be a group homomorphism. Then:
1. $\phi(e_G) = e_H$
2. $\phi(a^{-1}) = \phi(a)^{-1}$ for all $a \in G$
3. $\phi(a^n) = \phi(a)^n$ for all $a \in G$ and $n \in \mathbb{Z}$
</Theorem>

<Proof>
(1) We have $\phi(e_G) = \phi(e_G \cdot e_G) = \phi(e_G) \cdot \phi(e_G)$. Multiplying both sides by $\phi(e_G)^{-1}$ gives $e_H = \phi(e_G)$.

(2) We have $\phi(a) \cdot \phi(a^{-1}) = \phi(a \cdot a^{-1}) = \phi(e_G) = e_H$. Thus $\phi(a^{-1})$ is the inverse of $\phi(a)$.

(3) Follows by induction using (1) and (2).
</Proof>

<Definition number="1.6.3" name="Kernel and Image">
Let $\phi : G \to H$ be a homomorphism.

The **kernel** of $\phi$ is:
$$\ker(\phi) = \{a \in G : \phi(a) = e_H\}$$

The **image** of $\phi$ is:
$$\text{im}(\phi) = \{\phi(a) : a \in G\} = \phi(G)$$
</Definition>

<Theorem number="1.6.4">
Let $\phi : G \to H$ be a homomorphism. Then:
1. $\ker(\phi)$ is a subgroup of $G$
2. $\text{im}(\phi)$ is a subgroup of $H$
</Theorem>

<Definition number="1.6.5" name="Types of Homomorphisms">
A homomorphism $\phi : G \to H$ is called:
- A **monomorphism** (or **injection**) if $\phi$ is injective
- An **epimorphism** (or **surjection**) if $\phi$ is surjective
- An **isomorphism** if $\phi$ is bijective
- An **automorphism** if $\phi : G \to G$ is an isomorphism
</Definition>

<Theorem number="1.6.6">
A homomorphism $\phi : G \to H$ is injective if and only if $\ker(\phi) = \{e_G\}$.
</Theorem>

<Proof>
($\Rightarrow$) If $\phi$ is injective and $\phi(a) = e_H$, then $\phi(a) = \phi(e_G)$, so $a = e_G$.

($\Leftarrow$) If $\ker(\phi) = \{e_G\}$ and $\phi(a) = \phi(b)$, then $\phi(ab^{-1}) = \phi(a)\phi(b)^{-1} = e_H$, so $ab^{-1} \in \ker(\phi) = \{e_G\}$, giving $a = b$.
</Proof>

<Definition number="1.6.7" name="Isomorphic Groups">
Two groups $G$ and $H$ are **isomorphic**, written $G \cong H$, if there exists an isomorphism $\phi : G \to H$.
</Definition>

Isomorphic groups are "essentially the same" from an algebraic standpoint—they have identical group-theoretic properties, differing only in the names of their elements.

## 1.7 Cyclic Groups

Among all groups, the cyclic groups are the simplest and most completely understood. Despite their simplicity, they play a central role in the theory.

<Definition number="1.7.1" name="Cyclic Group">
A group $G$ is **cyclic** if there exists an element $g \in G$ such that every element of $G$ can be written as a power of $g$:
$$G = \{g^n : n \in \mathbb{Z}\} = \langle g \rangle$$
The element $g$ is called a **generator** of $G$.
</Definition>

<Example number="1.7.2">
The group $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$ is cyclic with generator $1$ (or $-1$). Every integer is a "power" of $1$ under addition: $n = 1 + 1 + \cdots + 1$ ($n$ times).
</Example>

<Example number="1.7.3">
The group $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is cyclic with generator $1$. It is the unique cyclic group of order $n$, up to isomorphism.
</Example>

<Theorem number="1.7.4" name="Classification of Cyclic Groups">
Every cyclic group is isomorphic to either $\mathbb{Z}$ (if infinite) or $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ for some positive integer $n$ (if finite of order $n$).
</Theorem>

<Theorem number="1.7.5">
Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.
</Theorem>

<Theorem number="1.7.6" name="Subgroups of Finite Cyclic Groups">
Let $G = \langle g \rangle$ be a cyclic group of order $n$. Then:
1. For each divisor $d$ of $n$, there is exactly one subgroup of order $d$
2. This subgroup is $\langle g^{n/d} \rangle$
</Theorem>

## Open Problems

<OpenResearch title="The Inverse Galois Problem" status="open">
Does every finite group appear as the Galois group of some polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$?

This problem, dating to the nineteenth century, connects group theory to field theory and algebraic geometry. While many families of groups are known to be Galois groups over $\mathbb{Q}$, a complete answer remains elusive.

This chapter established the foundations of group theory:

1. **Groups** are sets with an associative binary operation, an identity element, and inverses for all elements

2. **Fundamental properties** include uniqueness of identity and inverses, cancellation laws, and the formula $(ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}$

3. **Examples** range from number systems under addition or multiplication, to matrix groups, to symmetry groups of geometric objects

4. **Subgroups** are subsets that are themselves groups under the inherited operation

5. **Homomorphisms** are structure-preserving maps between groups; isomorphisms are bijective homomorphisms

6. **Cyclic groups** are generated by a single element and are completely classified

The theory developed here provides the foundation for all subsequent chapters. In Chapter 2, we will study *cosets* and *Lagrange's theorem*, which reveal deep connections between a group and its subgroups.
