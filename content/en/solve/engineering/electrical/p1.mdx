# Problem 7: RC Circuit Time Constant

## Problem Statement

Consider a series RC circuit with:
- A DC voltage source $V_s$
- A resistor with resistance $R$
- A capacitor with capacitance $C$, initially uncharged

At $t = 0$, the switch is closed.

Derive an expression for the voltage across the capacitor $V_C(t)$ as a function of time.

## Required Topics

- Kirchhoff's voltage law
- Capacitor current-voltage relationship
- First-order differential equations
- Exponential decay/growth
