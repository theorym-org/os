# Problem 2: Pumping Lemma for Regular Languages

## Problem Statement

Use the **Pumping Lemma for Regular Languages** to prove that the language:
$$L = \{0^n1^n : n \geq 0\}$$
is **not regular**.

## Required Topics

- Pumping lemma
- Regular languages
- Proof by contradiction
- String decomposition
- DFA limitations

## The Pumping Lemma

If $L$ is a regular language, then there exists a pumping length $p \geq 1$ such that:

For every string $s \in L$ with $|s| \geq p$, there exists a decomposition $s = xyz$ satisfying:
1. $|y| > 0$ (y is non-empty)
2. $|xy| \leq p$ (xy occurs within first p symbols)
3. For all $i \geq 0$: $xy^iz \in L$ (can pump y any number of times)

## Proof Strategy

1. **Assume** (for contradiction) that $L$ is regular
2. **Apply** the pumping lemma: there exists pumping length $p$
3. **Choose** a specific string $s \in L$ with $|s| \geq p$
4. **Consider** all possible decompositions $s = xyz$ satisfying conditions 1 and 2
5. **Find** some $i$ such that $xy^iz \notin L$
6. **Conclude** contradiction, so $L$ is not regular

## Suggested String

Choose $s = 0^p 1^p$ (clearly in $L$ and $|s| = 2p \geq p$).

## What to Show

1. Explain where $y$ must be located (hint: in the first $p$ symbols)
2. What does $y$ consist of? (only 0s, only 1s, or mixed?)
3. Find an $i$ such that $xy^iz$ has unequal numbers of 0s and 1s
4. Conclude $xy^iz \notin L$, contradicting the pumping lemma
