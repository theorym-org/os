# Problem 1: DFA Construction

## Problem Statement

Construct a **deterministic finite automaton (DFA)** that accepts the language:
$$L = \{w \in \{0,1\}^* : w \text{ contains an even number of 1s}\}$$

## Required Topics

- Deterministic finite automata (DFA)
- State machines
- Transition functions
- Regular languages
- Accept/reject states

## DFA Definition

A DFA is a 5-tuple $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ where:
- $Q$ = finite set of states
- $\Sigma$ = input alphabet
- $\delta: Q \times \Sigma \to Q$ = transition function
- $q_0 \in Q$ = initial state
- $F \subseteq Q$ = set of accept states

## What to Provide

1. **State set $Q$**: List all states needed
2. **Alphabet $\Sigma$**: $\{0, 1\}$
3. **Transition function $\delta$**: Give complete transition table
4. **Initial state $q_0$**: Specify which state
5. **Accept states $F$**: Which states are accepting?

## Example Format

**States**: $Q = \{q_0, q_1\}$

**Transition Table**:

| State | Input 0 | Input 1 |
|-------|---------|---------|
| $q_0$ | ?       | ?       |
| $q_1$ | ?       | ?       |

## Verification

Test your DFA on:
- $\varepsilon$ (empty string) → accept (0 ones is even)
- $1$ → reject (1 one is odd)
- $11$ → accept (2 ones is even)
- $101$ → reject (2 ones... wait, that's even!)
