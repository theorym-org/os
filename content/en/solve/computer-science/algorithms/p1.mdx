# Problem 6: Prove Binary Search Correctness

## Problem Statement

Consider the following binary search algorithm:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```

Prove the correctness of this algorithm using the loop invariant technique. Your proof should include:

1. **Initialization**: The invariant holds before the first iteration.
2. **Maintenance**: If the invariant holds before an iteration, it holds after.
3. **Termination**: The loop terminates and the invariant implies correctness.
