# Problem 1: NP-Completeness of 3-SAT

## Problem Statement

Prove that **3-SAT** is NP-complete.

**3-SAT**: Given a boolean formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF) where each clause has exactly 3 literals, determine if there exists a satisfying assignment.

## Required Topics

- NP-completeness
- Polynomial-time reductions
- Boolean satisfiability
- CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form)
- Cook-Levin theorem (SAT is NP-complete)

## What to Prove

To show 3-SAT is NP-complete, you must prove two things:

1. **3-SAT ∈ NP**: Show that a solution can be verified in polynomial time
2. **3-SAT is NP-hard**: Show that SAT ≤ₚ 3-SAT (reduce SAT to 3-SAT in polynomial time)

## Definitions

**SAT**: Given a boolean formula in CNF (clauses can have any number of literals), is it satisfiable?

**3-SAT**: Given a boolean formula in CNF where each clause has exactly 3 literals, is it satisfiable?

**Reduction**: $A \leq_p B$ means we can transform any instance of problem $A$ into an instance of problem $B$ in polynomial time.

## Strategy for Reduction (SAT → 3-SAT)

Given a SAT formula with clauses of varying sizes:

- **1 literal**: $(x_1)$ → convert to $(x_1 \vee x_1 \vee x_1)$
- **2 literals**: $(x_1 \vee x_2)$ → convert to $(x_1 \vee x_2 \vee x_2)$
- **3 literals**: $(x_1 \vee x_2 \vee x_3)$ → keep as is
- **k > 3 literals**: Split using auxiliary variables

For a clause with $k > 3$ literals $(x_1 \vee x_2 \vee \cdots \vee x_k)$:
- Introduce new variables $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_{k-3}$
- Replace with: $(x_1 \vee x_2 \vee y_1) \wedge (\neg y_1 \vee x_3 \vee y_2) \wedge \cdots$

Show that the original formula is satisfiable ⟺ the new 3-SAT formula is satisfiable.
