# Problem 2: Continuity and Uniform Continuity

## Problem Statement

Consider the function $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x) = x^2$.

Prove that:
1. $f$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R}$
2. $f$ is **not** uniformly continuous on $\mathbb{R}$

## Required Topics

- Epsilon-delta definition of continuity
- Uniform continuity
- Sequential characterization of continuity
- Counterexample construction

## Definitions

**Continuity at a point**: $f$ is continuous at $c$ if for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $|x - c| < \delta$ implies $|f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$.

**Uniform Continuity**: $f$ is uniformly continuous on $A$ if for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that for all $x, y \in A$, $|x - y| < \delta$ implies $|f(x) - f(y)| < \varepsilon$.

## What to Prove

1. Show continuity at an arbitrary point $c \in \mathbb{R}$
2. Find sequences that violate uniform continuity
