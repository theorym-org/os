# Problem 3: Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem

## Problem Statement

Prove the **Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem**:

Every bounded sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ has a convergent subsequence.

## Required Topics

- Bounded sequences
- Subsequences
- Nested interval property
- Monotone subsequences
- Completeness of real numbers

## Definitions

**Bounded Sequence**: A sequence $\{a_n\}$ is bounded if there exists $M > 0$ such that $|a_n| \leq M$ for all $n$.

**Subsequence**: A sequence $\{a_{n_k}\}$ where $n_1 < n_2 < n_3 < \cdots$ are indices from $\mathbb{N}$.

## Strategy

Given a bounded sequence $\{a_n\}$:
1. Show that $\{a_n\}$ is contained in some closed interval $[a, b]$
2. Use bisection to construct nested intervals containing infinitely many terms
3. Extract a convergent subsequence using the nested intervals
