# Problem 1: Prove Convergence of a Sequence

## Problem Statement

Prove that the sequence $\{a_n\}$ defined by $a_n = \frac{1}{n}$ converges to $0$ as $n \to \infty$.

Use the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ definition of sequence convergence to construct a rigorous proof.

## Required Topics

- Definition of sequence convergence
- Epsilon-delta proofs
- Archimedean property of real numbers
- Inequality manipulation

## Definition of Convergence

A sequence $\{a_n\}$ converges to $L$ if:

For every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n > N$:
$$|a_n - L| < \varepsilon$$

## What to Prove

Show that $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} = 0$ by finding an explicit $N$ in terms of $\varepsilon$.
