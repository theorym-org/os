# Problem 2: Fermat's Little Theorem

## Problem Statement

Prove **Fermat's Little Theorem**:

If $p$ is a prime number and $a$ is an integer not divisible by $p$, then:
$$a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$$

## Required Topics

- Prime numbers
- Modular arithmetic
- Congruences
- Multiplicative properties
- Permutations

## Definitions

**Congruence modulo p**: $a \equiv b \pmod{p}$ means $p \mid (a-b)$.

**Relatively prime**: $\gcd(a,p) = 1$ (which is automatic when $p$ is prime and $p \nmid a$).

## Strategy

1. Consider the set $S = \{a, 2a, 3a, \ldots, (p-1)a\}$
2. Show all elements of $S$ are distinct modulo $p$
3. Therefore, $S \equiv \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, p-1\} \pmod{p}$ (as sets)
4. Take the product of all elements
5. Simplify to get the result

## Corollary

For any integer $a$ and prime $p$: $a^p \equiv a \pmod{p}$
