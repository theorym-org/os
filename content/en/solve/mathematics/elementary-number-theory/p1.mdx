# Problem 1: Euclidean Algorithm and GCD

## Problem Statement

Using the Euclidean algorithm:

1. Find $\gcd(1071, 462)$
2. Express the GCD as a linear combination: $\gcd(1071, 462) = 1071s + 462t$ for integers $s$ and $t$

## Required Topics

- Division algorithm
- Euclidean algorithm
- Greatest common divisor (GCD)
- Bézout's identity
- Extended Euclidean algorithm

## The Euclidean Algorithm

For integers $a$ and $b$ with $a > b > 0$:
1. Divide: $a = bq + r$ where $0 \leq r < b$
2. If $r = 0$, then $\gcd(a,b) = b$
3. Otherwise, replace $(a,b)$ with $(b,r)$ and repeat

## What to Find

1. Show all steps of the Euclidean algorithm
2. Find the GCD
3. Work backwards to find integers $s$ and $t$
