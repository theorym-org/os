# Problem 2: Normal Subgroup Characterization

## Problem Statement

Let $G$ be a group and $H$ be a subgroup of $G$.

Prove that $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ (denoted $H \trianglelefteq G$) if and only if 
$$gHg^{-1} = H \quad \text{for all } g \in G$$

where $gHg^{-1} = \{ghg^{-1} : h \in H\}$ is the conjugate of $H$ by $g$.

## Required Topics

- Subgroups and cosets
- Normal subgroups
- Conjugation in groups
- Set equality proofs

## Key Definitions

**Normal Subgroup**: $H \trianglelefteq G$ if $gH = Hg$ for all $g \in G$ (left and right cosets are equal).

**Conjugation**: The conjugate of $h$ by $g$ is $ghg^{-1}$.
