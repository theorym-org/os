# Problem 3: Lagrange's Theorem Application

## Problem Statement

Let $G$ be a group of prime order $p$, where $p$ is a prime number.

Prove that:
1. Every non-identity element of $G$ generates the entire group
2. Therefore, $G$ is cyclic

## Required Topics

- Lagrange's Theorem
- Cyclic groups
- Order of elements and subgroups
- Properties of prime numbers

## Lagrange's Theorem

For any finite group $G$ and subgroup $H \leq G$:
$$|H| \text{ divides } |G|$$

## What to Prove

Show that if $g \in G$ and $g \neq e$ (identity), then $\langle g \rangle = G$.
