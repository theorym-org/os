# Problem 3: Quantum Harmonic Oscillator

## Problem Statement

A quantum harmonic oscillator has potential energy:
$$V(x) = \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2 x^2$$

Find:
1. The ground state energy $E_0$
2. The normalized ground state wave function $\psi_0(x)$

## Required Topics

- Time-independent Schrödinger equation
- Gaussian wave functions
- Normalization integrals
- Quantum harmonic oscillator
- Zero-point energy

## The Schrödinger Equation

$$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} + \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2x^2\psi = E\psi$$

## Strategy

1. Try a Gaussian form: $\psi_0(x) = Ae^{-\alpha x^2}$
2. Compute the first and second derivatives
3. Substitute into the Schrödinger equation
4. Match coefficients to find $\alpha$ and $E_0$
5. Normalize to find $A$

## Useful Integral

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-ax^2} dx = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{a}}$$

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2 e^{-ax^2} dx = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{a^3}}$$

## What to Find

1. Ground state energy: $E_0$ in terms of $\hbar$ and $\omega$
2. Wave function: $\psi_0(x)$ (properly normalized)
3. Show that $\alpha = \frac{m\omega}{2\hbar}$
