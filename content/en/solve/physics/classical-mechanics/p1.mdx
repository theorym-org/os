# Problem 1: Simple Harmonic Oscillator

## Problem Statement

A mass $m$ is attached to a spring with spring constant $k$ and can move horizontally without friction. The spring obeys Hooke's law: $F = -kx$.

1. Derive the equation of motion for the mass
2. Solve the differential equation to find $x(t)$, the position as a function of time
3. Express the solution in terms of the angular frequency $\omega = \sqrt{k/m}$

## Required Topics

- Newton's second law
- Hooke's law
- Second-order linear differential equations
- Initial conditions
- Simple harmonic motion

## Given Information

- Mass: $m$
- Spring constant: $k$
- Restoring force: $F = -kx$ (Hooke's law)
- Initial position: $x(0) = x_0$
- Initial velocity: $v(0) = v_0$

## What to Find

1. The differential equation: $m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + kx = 0$
2. General solution: $x(t)$ in terms of $\omega$, $x_0$, and $v_0$
3. The period of oscillation $T$
