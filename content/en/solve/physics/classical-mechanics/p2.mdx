# Problem 2: Central Force Motion

## Problem Statement

A particle of mass $m$ moves under the influence of a central force $\mathbf{F} = f(r)\hat{\mathbf{r}}$, where $f(r)$ is some function of the distance $r = |\mathbf{r}|$ from the origin, and $\hat{\mathbf{r}} = \mathbf{r}/r$ is the unit radial vector.

Prove that the angular momentum $\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{p}$ is conserved (constant in time).

## Required Topics

- Newton's second law
- Central forces
- Angular momentum
- Vector cross products
- Time derivatives of vector quantities
- Conservation laws

## Definitions

**Central Force**: A force directed along the line connecting the particle to the origin:
$$\mathbf{F} = f(r)\hat{\mathbf{r}}$$

**Angular Momentum**: 
$$\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{p} = \mathbf{r} \times m\mathbf{v}$$

## What to Prove

Show that $\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \mathbf{0}$, which means angular momentum is conserved.

## Key Identity

Product rule for cross products: $\frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B}) = \frac{d\mathbf{A}}{dt} \times \mathbf{B} + \mathbf{A} \times \frac{d\mathbf{B}}{dt}$
