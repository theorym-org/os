# Problem 1: Gauss's Law - Electric Field of a Sphere

## Problem Statement

A solid sphere of radius $R$ has total charge $Q$ uniformly distributed throughout its volume.

Using **Gauss's Law**, find the electric field $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r})$ as a function of distance $r$ from the center:

1. Inside the sphere: $r < R$
2. Outside the sphere: $r > R$

## Required Topics

- Gauss's law
- Electric fields
- Spherical symmetry
- Charge distributions
- Volume integrals
- Flux calculations

## Gauss's Law

$$\oint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \frac{Q_{\text{enclosed}}}{\epsilon_0}$$

where the integral is over a closed surface $S$.

## Setup

**Charge density** (uniform):
$$\rho = \frac{Q}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3} = \frac{3Q}{4\pi R^3}$$

**Gaussian surface**: Choose spherical surfaces of radius $r$ centered at the origin.

## What to Find

1. **For $r < R$ (inside)**:
   - Calculate $Q_{\text{enclosed}}(r)$
   - Apply Gauss's law
   - Find $E(r)$

2. **For $r > R$ (outside)**:
   - $Q_{\text{enclosed}} = Q$ (all charge)
   - Apply Gauss's law
   - Find $E(r)$

3. Show continuity at $r = R$

## Expected Results

- Inside: $E(r) \propto r$ (linear)
- Outside: $E(r) \propto 1/r^2$ (like a point charge)
